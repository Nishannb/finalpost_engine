# BGM Phase 2 morning report

Branch: `bgm-phase-2`. Not pushed.

## 1. Spend proof

- `agents/music_specialist/spend.log` before the run: absent (0 lines).
- After T1: still absent (0 lines).
- Runware calls: 0. Lambda renders: 0. Gemini/Groq/Claude generation calls: 0.

## 2. Per task

### Checkpoint

- Status: done.
- Commit: `54f7e9de92a942e57871b17b3efd1fbf46d93f0d` `phase 1.1 checkpoint`.
- The working tree on `main` had never been committed past the early engine. This checkpoint is that whole source tree plus Phase 1.1, excluding `.env`, `agents/.venv`, `__pycache__`, and `captionkit_tmp`.
- Stash list was empty.

### T1. Content-mood map

- Status: done.
- Files: `server/src/stages/music/contentMoodMap.json`, `flags.ts`, `musicSpecialist.test.ts`, `agents/music_specialist/prompts.py`, `tests/test_content_mood_map.py`.
- Tests: pytest 24 passed; vitest 42 passed (musicBed, musicSpecialist, wp27); server tsc clean; Remotion tsc only the 3 known `ShortVideo.tsx` errors.
- `tech_sharp` now resolves to `high-energy` before the keyword buckets. An unknown tone logs `music.mood_unmapped` and becomes `neutral`. `neutral talking-head` does not log.
- Commit: filled in after this commit.

## 3. Flags

None added yet.

## 4. Numbers from T2 and T10

Not run.

## 5. Listen list

Not produced yet.

## 6. Decisions for the human

- `tech_sharp` → `high-energy`. The visual theme is sharp/tech, the brief asked for high-energy unless a better fit, and the only real bed is the 128 bpm A minor high-energy bed. Other visual moods: warm_intimate→nostalgic, calm_cool→calm, bold_energetic→high-energy, clean_light→neutral, dark_cinematic→tense, earthy_natural→calm, soft_pastel→calm.
- T10's `npm run first-video` calls Groq and Gemini. Those are paid APIs, so that full command will not be run. A local Remotion render that does not call them will be used if the code can do it without a new analyze.

## 7. Commands for the human (do not run overnight)

Filled in after T8.
